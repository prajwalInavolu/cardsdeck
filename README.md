I used spring boot application to create the test cases. 

You download the project do following Steps:

1. Import the project into IDE- Import- Maven Project- existing maven project
2.open pom.xml
3. Right click on file and maven- click update project(This will donwload all the required libs)
4. Locate file "CardsApplicationTests" and open it
5. right click on the class name and click- run as- Junit tests. 
6. Check the Junit view.. You should be able to see all the test ran successfully. 


I wrote test cases for all API and wrote more than on for some API. 

I didnt understand the complete logic(i am very bad in cards :)). I wrote from using the response. But real time will be different. 
We have to write them according to business needs. 

Change or modify the values accordingly to test. 

I used rest assured for this. 


Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
